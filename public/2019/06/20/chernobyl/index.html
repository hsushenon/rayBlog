<p>&ldquo;What is the cost of lies? It’s not that we will mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that, if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories? In these stories, it doesn’t matter who the heroes are. All we want to know is who is to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just finished watching the mini-series, it&rsquo;s a must watch, high-quality stuff. I must say HBO is making some very good shows. What I like about the show is the drama created is very intense, you are instantly intrigued from the start, and the pace keeps up right till the end. The production quality and acting are superb. The other thing I like about it is, it is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>We have all heard read about the Chernobyl disaster, but for most people, like me, we do not realize the magnitude of the disaster, the high cost and the danger which was avoided. This brings the Chernobyl disaster into better perspective for me. I read about it a bit, even though it has some fiction in it. I will say it is an important work, which hopefully more people see it.</p>
<p>It is especially important now, cause if you look at the world now, it is full of lies/fake news/propaganda. It caused the Chernobyl disaster to happen then, and we are going to have another disaster if we do not do something about it. If we just let lies win, it will happen. For example, take something like climate change. It is a fact, it is a disaster waiting to happen if we do not do enough. But here also lots of lies are spread, and if powerful people like Trump who has large followers keep at the lies, keep disbelieving, then we are going to build this up and over time another disaster will happen.</p>
<p>“Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid.”</p>
