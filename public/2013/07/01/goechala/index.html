<p>A few weeks back I went to trekking with some friends to a place call Goechala(Sikkim). Here are few comments and photos about that experience.</p>
<p>“Trek is a long, adventurous journey undertaken on foot in areas where common means of transport are generally not available.”</p>
<p><strong>Walking</strong> It&rsquo;s one of the strange things in life I like to do, it is a habit I picked up from my childhood. In those days I walked to places(rather than take public transport) to save few rupees :) , but now I still do it just because I like it. I guess I like it because I enjoy that pace of traveling and like looking at things. It also facilitates the thinking process(there are few problems in life I fixed while walking :) ).</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I went for trekking. In total, we walked almost 90 kms in about 7 days that&rsquo;s more than 10 kms per day!! One day we started at 2 am at night and finished at 1 pm in the afternoon, that&rsquo;s almost 12 hours of walking!! We were like walking on a road which did not end. Trekking is a real test of both physical and mental strength.</p>
<p><strong>Snow</strong> My one wish was to see snow, I have never seen it in real life except inside a fridge. It was a wonderful site, snow everywhere, once it was snowing when we were walking. The flip side is, it is terribly difficult to walk on snow/ice. More than once I fell down. One of the very important things is to get a very good shoe with grip for trekking. I had bought an expensive “Spalding” shoe for this, after a while(and few falls) I realize, that was not working for me and switched to cheaper “Titas” shoe(from my dad shop cost 5 times lesser!!)</p>
<p><strong>Toilet</strong> Ok, dont read this part if you do not like toilet humor :). One of the reasons I think that ladies might stay away from trekking is this. If you are a very hygienic person you will have lots of problems. The toilets(when available) are what I call “medieval type” there is a small enclosure and inside a hole. There are many times you will rather not use this toilet and do it in nature&rsquo;s one cause some people’s aim is not quite right  (There were many ladies going on the trek and one was in our group. I was very impressed by the determination shown by her. It&rsquo;s just that you need to get the right mental setup.)</p>
<p><strong>Mountain</strong> You will not believe the view, it&rsquo;s simply breathtaking, it makes all the hard work worthwhile. You see the photos and say wow but if you see it in real it&rsquo;s something else, you can&rsquo;t really describe it. I was a bit down one day but one look at the mountain and my spirit went up instantly.</p>
