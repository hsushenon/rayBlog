<p>I slept at 3am due to a dinner social event that ended late and also my pre-sleep bad habit of labouring over specification, benchmark, review, and pricing of desktop computer parts and camera equipment. <a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2012/03/04/10-tips-on-how-to-cure-yourself-of-gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome/">G.A.S</a> attack comes and goes but it is especially brutal between the November to January Birthday-Christmas season. I am close to the bottom of that now but that is a story for another day.</p>
<p>So this morning, sleepy and lethargic, I was vacuuming the basement and not enjoying it at all when I found a small toy in a corner. Recognising it as a Shopkin, I gave it to my daughter who was happy to get it back. She said &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s my <a href="http://shopkin.toys/shopkins/54/1-054:jelly-b:rare">Jelly Bean Joe</a><sup>*</sup>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And just like that, life is interesting again!</p>

* Online, I found references to Jelly B. but not _Jelly Bean Joe_ so I asked my son. He educated me that it is a character from the TV show Odd Squad.
