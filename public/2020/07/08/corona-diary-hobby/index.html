<p>One thing being quarantined at home for so long teaches you is being creative about how you spend your time. I look at my dad’s routine, he basically just sleeps, eats, and watches TV/mobile/iPad, and very little of anything else. And that got me thinking that I need something other than just being a couch potato.</p>
<p>I am thinking, everyone needs to have some kind of hobby/interest to keep us busy.</p>
<p>I need to find one for myself. At various times I tried learning guitar, learning mandarin, doing some creative writing. All eventually either I gave up on or lost interest in. The only interest I have which has sustained me all these years is my love for reading but that again is a little too passive.</p>
<p>It has to involve some, even minor physical activity. I will keep looking else I will end up like my dad.</p>
