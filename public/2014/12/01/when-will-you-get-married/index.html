<p>If you are reading this, you probably have asked me this question already or you have thought about it. If by chance you have landed on this site and do not know me, for your sake I am giving a little background. I am a 33 years old man and still single( as of the year 2015). So anyone who basically cares about me is a little bit worried about my current status :).</p>
<p>Here is an attempt to answer this question. My current state about marriage is what I call &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; state. OK, need to explain how I arrived at this. This term is basically picked up from one of my favorite book &ldquo;Godfather&rdquo; by Mario Puzo. (If you have not read it, I recommend it). So this is what happens in the book, Michael Corleone after killing a police officer runs away to Sicily and lives in exile. There he meets a woman who he is instantly attracted to. His bodyguards claim that Michael has been hit by what Sicilians calls &ldquo;the Thunderbolt&rdquo;. Michael soon marries the woman. If you start to think &ldquo;Godfather&rdquo; is a romantic novel, here is the bummer. The woman shortly gets blown by a bomb!</p>
<p>So here is my point about marriage, unless a &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; hits me, I am staying happily single. The only issue now for me is, how do you explain to your parents that you have been inspired by a cold-blooded killer, they will kill you!! :)</p>
