  <h2> About Me </h2><article>
<p>I started this website cause I wanted to get into a habit of putting my thoughts to words and then getting it documented. I am a software developer by profession, though this will mostly be a personal blog so it will contain random thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>
<p>The movie menu you see is a list of movies I have seen and ranked, its little game I play with myself. I love watching movies and started to note it down sometime in the year 2014. What I do is whenever I watch a movie which is at least a ‘one time watch’ i put it on the list, I compare the movie with the ones in the list and put it where I think it’s ranked. This is what I do if I were given a choice between movie A and movie B if I choose movie A, then movie A goes above movie B, and then I compare with the next movie. It’s not a perfect science as I sometimes would go back and rearrange it but it mostly works. This is partially inspired by an idea of ranking app my brother had.</p>
