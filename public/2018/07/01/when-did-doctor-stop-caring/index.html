<p>Last week I took my dad to see his regular diabetes doctor. He has been visiting the same doctor for a while now, and generally goes on his own. This time I thought it would be good if I talked to the doctor myself, as whenever I asked dad after a visit he says the doctor did not say anything just that everything is normal.</p>
<p>So I took off from work and reached the clinic at 4 PM. The doctor came at 5:30 PM that already frustrated me, but I would have given the doctor a pass on being late as it may be he was checking on other patients. My dad says this happens everytime he goes, so this doctor is a regular latecomer and just does not value his patients time.</p>
<p>Anyway, when we go inside his chamber he is talking on his phone, signals us to sit. The attitude already seems off to me. He checks the reports and just writes in the prescription to continue same medication and to visit him again in three months. I try to ask questions and he gives a very little answer, I almost have to more forceful with my questions for him to give a better answer. But that also was not why I got upset. What upset me was even before we left and my dad was having some parting words with him, he was already looking at his phone barely acknowledging us.</p>
<p>I have been noticing this kind of behaviour by few doctors. To me, doctors like teachers are only a few noble profession. You do it not only because you make money but also because you really care and you want to help people. Maybe I am being foolish here in thinking I should expect it to be better. I do know quite a few doctors who do show kindness, but its increasing rare which is a shame.</p>
