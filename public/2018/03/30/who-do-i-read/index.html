<p>He is probably the oldest writer I still follow now regularly. I started to read him when an article came in Hindustan Times on Sunday. He writes on varied topics mostly related to India. He is also a very good food critic.</p>

<p>He was mentioned to me by my brother, from then on I have been following his posts. I have a keen interest in all thing Microsoft, and he writes very well about them. I also like the fact that he is very critical in his writings, you can’t call him a fanboy. If you read many tech writers, sometimes it feels like there is a bias.</p>

<p>One of my regular podcast watches is twit, he comes sometimes and I found his thoughts interesting.  His blog is mostly tech and related stuff, he writes very well, worth a read.Additionally, his photography skill is pretty good.</p>

<p>One of Om’s post mentioned him, he is an amazing photographer. I love his work, especially the very interesting one he did on taking one photo per day for a whole year.</p>

<p>I started reading her short article in the Sunday magazine which came with Hindustan Times newspaper. Her sharp and witty take on different topics make her article very interesting to read.</p>
