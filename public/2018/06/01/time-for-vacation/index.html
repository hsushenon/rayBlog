<p>The other day I was listening to the radio, and the discussion going on between the people were if they used up their leaves which they are entitled to by their respective companies. Two out of three said they did not take many leaves.</p>
<p>Every new month I get a mail from HR giving the status of leaves I have taken and what is pending. Last checked I have accumulated 136 outstanding leaves! What is more astounding is, it is not as if I can cash these pending leaves. One day when policy change it will just be reset. So I might have nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>I used to think that if I did not need it why to take leaves. I generally am healthy and on only few occasions I would take a long vacation. So over nine years, I have piled up this number. Which I now feel is a wastage, I should take more leaves even if it means sitting at home and watching the full Breaking Bad series in one go ðŸ™‚</p>
