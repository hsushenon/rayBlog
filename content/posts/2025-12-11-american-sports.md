Football is my favourite sport and the one which I follow most. In recent years, I have come to enjoy and follow American sports too. Basketball was a familiar one that I picked up again in recent years. I have also started following the NFL and baseball. These were mostly influenced by watching YouTube clips of highlights and discussions on them on YouTube and podcasts like TheRinger.


**Basketball**

In the 90s, there was a huge hype about Michael Jordan all over the world. I think that because of him, the sport became popular everywhere around the world. I remember we used to play basketball in my school days also. It was still not a sport I followed much then, partly because it was not easily accessible to watch the games. I still don’t watch much of the actual game; the timing is the main reason now. I follow it by listening to podcasts and going to ESPN and other sites regularly to get updates. Mostly though, I watch Youtube, there are many people who talk about the sport in interesting and entertaining ways. My Basketball team is the LA Lakers because I am a fan of Luka Doncic, and the Denver Nuggets because of Nikola Jokic.

**NFL**

This is the strange one that I got interested in the more I started to understand it. I have watched a few matches live, and it was entertaining. There are still many rules I do not understand, but the main ones I know. My favourite team is the San Francisco 49ers, I like their Running Back Christian McCaffrey. The NFL is such a physical and brutal force; it's great to see a Running Back just ramming his way through people to get as far as possible.

**Baseball**

When I went to Canada, my brother and I went to see the Toronto Blue Jays play the Houston Astros. It was a fun experience. Since I started to follow the Dodgers because of Shohei Ohtani, I recently watched the World Series. They were great games. Especially the final game 7. It was one of the best finals in any sport I watched. There were so many dramatic moments throughout the game. I have not watched a game/match so intensely for a long time now, unless it's an Arsenal match. Shohei Ohtani is probably my favourite sports star now across all sports.
