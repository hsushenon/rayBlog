On the last day of 2023, I went to bed early. I don't celebrate New Year like most people, don't get the point, it's just another day. My sister called up and we were chatting in general. In the end of the call, she pushed me to do one thing new the new year day, to get my lazy bum outside the house. As it turns out, I had a holiday on New Year's Day. So I went out, I visited an H&M store, which I had never been to before, and bought a couple of shirts. So my new thing for the new year was done. Afterward, my sister started putting in my head that for the New Year I need to do more new things!! 

The other day I came across a blog by Om Malik, someone I like to read regularly. He talked about a new project he is going to work on, basically, it is to take one photo a day for the full year.  That interested me, but I know it is impossible for me to take a photo a day. So I plan instead to do project 52, a photo a week for the full year.

On further thought I am going to push myself to do more in 2024, the plan is 

A photo a week
A blog a month
A book a quarter
An international travel a year

Let's see how it works out by the end of the year.
