I love sports, especially football. Arsenal is the only club I can say am a true fan of. It all started in the late 90s, in those days not like now when you have a lot of live sport on TV but World cup football was a still big deal, everyone would tune in and watch it. In one the matches, I remember one particular goal by Bergkamp [goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtXo-8tThAg)  in the world cup that fascinated me. It was just sublime skill, from there on I became a fan of Bergkamp, of course, he went on to score many more beautiful [goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw8RaB_ioRs). Since I was a fan and he came to Arsenal I started following Arsenal.

It was a great time to follow the gunners, they use to regularly win trophies or at least be challenging for the top prize. Then there was the unbelievable invincible team. Most of all I love Arsenal because of how they played. They played the beautiful game beautifully. The main reason was that they had a manager in Arsene Wenger, whose philosophy was simple. He believed that football has to be played in a certain way, and that way was beautiful passing attacking football. Under him, Arsenal became from being called ‘Boring, boring’ to one most of the most entertaining club. You just have to see some of the team goals they have scored to [see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7wNwkJ4CB4).

He was responsible for bringing numerous exciting footballers we got to see, Bergkamp, Pires, Henry, Fabregas, Ozil and so on. He had enormous faith in his brand of football. His belief in that philosophy was so strong that, the second decade of his career though there was plenty of criticism he never wavered. Many argue, including me that he was too set in his way. Arsenal needed a change and in his last few years, most people could see that we were not really challenging for the major trophies, worse we were probably degrading.

So the club even when it did not want to, had to let him go. I am happy it went this way, and unlike other clubs which fires managers so easily. Arsenal showed patience and did it the dignified way. There are many qualities I admire about him when you hear him speak there is always a dignity to it. He is a man of top quality, his conduct has always been top class.

He might not have won as many trophies as I would have liked. But I would not trade watching wonderful football for it. Thank you, Arsene for all the entertainment. Merci Arsene.
