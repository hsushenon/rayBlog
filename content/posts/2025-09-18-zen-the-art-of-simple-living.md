This is my latest read, a book by Shunmyo Masuno, a Buddhist monk who is also a garden designer, which is quite interesting.

It discusses 100 topics, each one covered in small paragraphs. It's easy to read with lots of useful stuff. Here are some of the interesting ones I found.


**Try using a loud voice**

“It stimulates and activates your brain.”. I usually never talk, which is a complaint even my mum has of me for a very long time. It tells us to vocalise more, speak loudly sometimes.

**Exhale deeply**

“Improve your breathing, and your mind, too, will improve”. We all know breathing exercises are good for us.  

**Become adept at switching mode**

“You might think of your commute to work as a similar ‘necessary non-essential’. It can provide time for you to switch between your private self and your work self.’” This is a thing I have believed in, it says to have different personas, like one for work and one for home. So when you are home, you should keep the stuff from work out.

**Create a small garden on your balcony** 

“A place where your mind can escape”. I think this is a great hobby to have, to grow something on your own. To plant the seed to nurture it, see it grow. I am currently into Aquascaping; it's a fun activity.

**Discover another you**

“There is another you within yourself. This version of you is freer than the self you think you know, and rich with potential”.  You need to find it.

**Get active**

“Experience for yourself hot and cold.” This is something we have to be conscious of doing. It's too easy to get into the habit of staying home all day, watching TV, or being on the computer. You need to push yourself to get active. Find a hobby that will push you physically and mentally. Go discover new places, travel. Some things you can appreciate only when you do them yourself.

**Try just sitting quietly in nature**

“Try sitting and having a dialogue with nature”. It's refreshing to be with nature. One of my favourite things to do is going on a trek.

**Don’t fixate on right and wrong**

“This is about compromise. If you fuss over black and white, you miss out on the beauty of grey.”
This is a nice way of thinking that sometimes things are not simply one side or another. There are many things in the middle that are more right.

**Line up your shoes when you take them off**

“Disorder in your mind shows in your feet.” My sister shared with me a photo of this page from the book, which was the first topic I read from the book. She asked me to follow this. I think this is a good practice to follow. To have things in order, even small things.

**Discard what you don't need**

“Part with old things before acquiring new ones”. It's important to be clutter free both in mind and your physical being.

**Don't be bound by single perspective** 

“There is more than just ‘the proper way.’” Objects do not have merely one purpose. We need to have different perspectives.
