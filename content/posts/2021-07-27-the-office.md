One of the things during the Pandemic is you consume even more streaming content.
I have found myself spending long hours daily moving from Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Sony Liv. Binge-watching long series has become a regular practice. One of the best ones, which I enjoyed from start till finish, is The Office. The 9 seasons have all been super funny and highly enjoyable to watch. I would say it's probably ranked second in comedy series after my favorite Seinfeld.

**Premise**

“This mockumentary follows the everyday lives of the manager and the employees he ‘manages.’ The crew follows the employees around 24/7 and captures their quite humorous and bizarre encounters as they will do what it takes to keep the company thriving.” -IMDB

The way they show how the show plays out and in parallel, the characters get to interview the shooting crew explaining their opinions of the current situation. Then, in the end, it goes meta, where the show is showing the show which was shot during all the years. It is very creative and interesting.


**Characters**

All the characters and people who acted are great and interesting. The character itself is very different and interesting, plus the people who acted did their job very well. I love all of them. The mark of a great movie/series is that people remember the characters even after many years. I am sure Micheal, Jim, Dwight, Pam will remain with me for a very long time.


**Writings**

After going through more into the behind-the-scenes of the show, one of the main reasons for the success of the show is the writers. Many actors in the shows also double as writers and producers for the show. The storyline, the characters are all very good because they were written very well. There are only a few times when you feel that these episodes are not fun, that this storyline is no good. Almost all the episodes had a good story, that is saying a lot for a series that had 9 seasons.


**Moments**

There are many scenes that I loved.

*Forever song for the wedding*
The whole scene was shot, choreographed beautifully with so much fun in it. Also if you go through the Youtube rabbit hole with this, you will find many people recreated this which are also fun to watch.

*The roast of Michael Scott*
The episode when all the employees get their chance to roast their boss was funny. It is like everyone got their ultimate chance to take a dig.

*Goodbye Michael*
The episode when Micheal Scott leaves the show was done beautifully. It did feel like genuinely they all loved Micheal and gave him a grand farewell.

*First Aid Fail*
There are many crazy memorable scenes of Dwight. This is one such where he goes over the top.

*Dundies*
Another interesting original idea that was introduced, to give ridiculous awards to employees for ridiculous reasons. Super funny.

Overall I loved the show, and enjoyed it thoroughly and it is totally worth bingeing and rewatching it.
