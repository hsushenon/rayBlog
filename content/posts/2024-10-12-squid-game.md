At the end of this year season 2 of Squid Game will be released. I remember how much I was into it. It was one of the best shows I saw during the pandemic. I did not start watching when it got released, but soon I started seeing the buzz. Everyone was talking about it, it became a global phenomenon. I do not remember any show that no one had heard of before catching fire like this. It became the No. 1 show for Netflix in most of the countries. 

When I heard a podcast about it, I was immediately intrigued and decided to watch it. I was immediately hooked and binge-watched the whole show. After that, I started searching for more content about it. My verdict was that it was a very violent, bloody show, but the violence was justified and shown perfectly. The acting and direction were great. The biggest USP of the show is the suspense. There were many shocking moments, and it was awesome to watch.

It used very creative ways to turn a fun kid game into a deadly game. I would not go into detail otherwise it would spoil it. From the very first episode, you understand the stakes, everyone in the show soon gets to know how serious this is, and you as an audience are on full alert from then on. 

One of the genres of YouTube that interests me is the react videos. It's very entertaining to watch these Youtubers react to movies/songs and comment on them. The reaction videos on the show were a lot of fun. I watched those videos on a loop. It was super fun to watch people react to certain scenes about it. 

Since the series was so great to me and it ended well also. I do not like that they are continuing and making season 2. I don't agree that limited series when they become super successful, you need to make more seasons. I can't see how the new season will be great, but still, it will be intriguing to see it.
