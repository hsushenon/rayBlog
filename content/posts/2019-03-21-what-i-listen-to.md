The good thing about a long commute between home and work is that you have lots of free time which you can utilize to good use. One way I utilize that time is to listen to music and podcast. I love listening to these, here is a list of current favorites.

 

**Gaana**

Gaana is great if you love music and spend lots of time listening to it. It is cross-platform, so I can access it on the web and as an app on my phone. I use to use the free version which was great, but now I pay for the subscription which cost me 200 Rs for 6 months. It is a great deal for me as its cheap, there are no ads, also the feature to download music and listen offline is very useful, as there are many places like metro where the net is weak.

**This Week in Tech**

I love Twit, I listen to many of their shows regularly. My favorite among them is This week in tech. The show is produced very well, Leo is a great host, and generally, they bring a lot of very good guest. The conversation is often insightful, interesting and fun. They also dig deep into topics I have interest in.

**This Week in Google**

This is the second show I regularly listen to on Twit. It is very similar to TwiT, only it is more focused on Google and has fixed guests. Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham both are great and gives interesting perspective in the show.

**The Filmcast**

Watching films is one of my favorite pastimes. I also like reading, listening to it. I found this podcast after listening to a few others, and I like this one more because of how the three guys talk about it. They talk about the latest movies and reviews them, the conversation is interesting and fun.

**The Rewatchables**

Similar to Filmcast podcast this one also has great hosts who talk in depth about a movie. Its USP is it selects movie based on how rewatchable it is. We all have our old favorite movies which we rewatch multiple times. This is great as basically, they are talking about those special movies. I discovered many good old movies which I have not to watch before.
